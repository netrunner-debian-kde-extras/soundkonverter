Known Bugs:
(- if you use a kde version minor 4.4.0 please keep in mind that the libkcompact disc shipped with kde contains a bug
  causing soundkonverter to crash everytime it tries to close the cd drive. so you need to add the cd tracks, save the files list, restart
  and load the file list again. in order to avoid this bug, upgrade to kde 4.4.0 or higher or compile an updated version of libkcompactdisc)
- if you use a kde version minor 4.4.0 please keep in mind that the libkcompact disc shipped with kde contains a bug
  causing soundkonverter to crash everytime it tries to close the cd drive. that's why the libkcompactdisc doesn't get deleted in KDE < 4.4.0
  making it necessary to restart soundkonverter when changing the cd
